## Features
* Guide to how the website works

When you enter my website, you would notice that there are 4 categories:
Projects
About
Contact
Repositories
When you click on each of them, they will take you to different layers of the website that showcase all my work and projects!

* Notice how there are are two symbols for each project/websites. The github symbol will take you to the github project page and the internet symbol will take you to the site itself.

* The 4th category is special. It will take you to a different page that contains all of my repositories from github that I wish to show in my website.

* So there is a secret feature in the website that is only exclusive to me.(I won't tell you how to get there) There is actually a 5th category called Control. When you get there, there is an engine that reads from an api that contains all the projects and repositories from my github and shows them all to me. If I so desire to add them to my website, I can press on the "create" button and it will push the project in the respository category.
